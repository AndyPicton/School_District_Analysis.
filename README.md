# School_District_Analysis.
## Overview of the school district analysis: 
After helping Maria build data frames to analyze data for 15 schools and almost 40,000 students, the school board found evidence of academic dishonesty from the Thomas High School 9th grade class in reading and math. I was tasked with replacing the math and reading scores for Thomas High School then reanalyzing the districts results.

## Results: 

### District Summary

The district summary was not drastically affected by the changes made. The top image shows the data that includes 9th grade Thomas High School scores and the bottom shows the updated data summary.

How is the school summary affected?

Replacing the Thomas High School 9th grade class did affect the schools rankings by quite a lot. The original data (top picture) shows Thomas High School having all % passing in the 90s for reading and math but the manipulated data (bottom picture) shows all % passing in the 60s.

How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
### Math Scores

Replacing the 9th graders math scores only affected the 9th grade for Thomas High School, nothing else changed.

School spending did not change with with the change in data.

### Scores by school size

Modifying the 9th grade Thomas High School students did not move the school into a different size bracket so this data remained unchanged.

### Scores by school type

Replacing the 9th grade data had no affect on the school type.


## Summary: 
Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
