# School_District_Analysis.
## Overview of the school district analysis: 
After helping Maria build data frames to analyze data for 15 schools and almost 40,000 students, the school board found evidence of academic dishonesty from the Thomas High School 9th grade class in reading and math. I was tasked with replacing the math and reading scores for Thomas High School then reanalyzing the districts results.

## Results:

The district summary was not drastically affected by the changes made. The top image shows the data that includes 9th grade Thomas High School scores and the bottom shows the updated data summary.

How is the school summary affected?
